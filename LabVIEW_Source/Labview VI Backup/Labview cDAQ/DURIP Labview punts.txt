Punts.

1. Convert AI DAQ from floats to int16 to potentially increase number of samples acquirable 
per run and also decrease stored data file size.

2. Code more flexibility into number of channels configured for Tx/Rx to allow user to increase
performance. 1, 2, 3, or 4 Tx channels independently of 1, 2, 3, or 4 RX channels.

3. Start TX on a second boundary.

4. Implement command versus transmit mode.
